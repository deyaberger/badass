  Please comply with the following rules:

  - Remain polite, courteous, respectful and constructive throughout the 
    evaluation process. The well-being of the community depends on it.

  - Identify with the student or group whose work is evaluated the possible 
    dysfunctions in their project. Take the time to discuss and debate the 
    problems that may have been identified.

  - You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers 
    might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its 
    functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as 
    possible. The pedagogy is useful only and only if the peer-evaluation is 
    done seriously.

guidelines_md: |
  - Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated 
    student or group.

  - Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that 
    the project is the one expected. Also, check that 'git clone' is used in an 
    empty folder.

  - Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you and make you 
    evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.

  - To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used 
    to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).

  - If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have 
    to read the entire subject prior to starting the evaluation process.

  - Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning 
    program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth. 
    In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0, 
    or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, student are 
    strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in, in order 
    to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.

    guidelines: |
        - Defense can only happen if the evaluated student or group is present. 
          This way everybody learns by sharing knowledge with each other.
        - If no work has been submitted (or wrong files, wrong directory, or 
          wrong filenames), the grade is 0, and the evaluation process ends.
        - For this project, you have to clone their Git repository on their 
          station.
